# MAGIC ### Basic LSTM Model
# MAGIC This section outlines the implementation of a basic Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, designed to establish a baseline for forecasting accuracy:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Model Architecture:
# MAGIC - Two LSTM Layers: These layers are used to capture the temporal dependencies in the sequential data, learning patterns over time.
# MAGIC - One Dense Layer: The final Dense layer processes the output from the LSTM layers to generate the predicted value.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Purpose:
# MAGIC - The basic LSTM model serves as the standard approach for handling time series data. It allows the model to learn from past data points and make predictions based on learned patterns.
# MAGIC - The Dense layer at the end of the model is responsible for transforming the LSTM output into the final forecasted value, providing a straightforward prediction.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This model acts as the foundation, against which more complex models and enhancements will be compared.

# MAGIC - Lag_1, Lag_7, Lag_30: These features represent the values of the target variable at previous time steps (e.g., 1 hour ago, 7 hours ago, 30 hours ago). They help the model capture dependencies between the current value and its past values, which is crucial for time series forecasting.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Combining External Factors:
# MAGIC - Temperature_Celsius, Humidity_Percentage: These external features are included to account for the impact of weather conditions on energy usage, as these factors can significantly influence consumption patterns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC By engineering these features, the model is equipped with a richer set of inputs that better capture the underlying dynamics of the data, leading to more accurate predictions.

# MAGIC ### Discussion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
# MAGIC The MAE is almost identical to the base model (111.69 vs. 111.71), indicating that the addition of time-based, lagged, and external factor features did not significantly impact the average prediction accuracy.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
# MAGIC The MSE shows a slight decrease from 16,718.18 in the base model to 16,699.94 in the feature-engineered model. This suggests a minor improvement in reducing larger errors, but the overall impact is limited.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **R-squared:**
# MAGIC The R-squared value improved slightly from -0.0067 to -0.0036. While still negative, this improvement indicates a small increase in the model's ability to explain variability in the data, though it remains insufficient for strong predictive power.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **True vs Predicted Monthly Energy Cost:**
# MAGIC The feature-engineered model aligns slightly better with the actual data compared to the base model. However, the model continues to struggle with certain temporal patterns, leading to deviations in predictions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Training & Validation Loss:**
# MAGIC The training and validation loss curves indicate that the model is learning effectively, but the persistent gap between the two suggests overfitting. The slight improvement in validation loss suggests that feature engineering may have contributed to marginally better generalization.

# MAGIC ## 2. Hyperparameter Tuning
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Hyperparameter tuning is essential for optimizing the performance of machine learning models by finding the best combination of parameters:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Set up the Grid Search:
# MAGIC - Define the Range of Hyperparameters: Identify the key hyperparameters to tune (e.g., number of LSTM units, dropout rate, batch size, epochs) and set up a grid of possible values for each. This allows systematic exploration of different combinations to find the optimal settings.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the Grid Search:
# MAGIC - Fit the Model Using Different Combinations: Execute the grid search across the defined parameter space, training the model with each combination and evaluating its performance. The goal is to identify the hyperparameter values that yield the best model performance, typically measured by metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Mean Squared Error (MSE).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This tuning process is crucial for maximizing the model's predictive accuracy and ensuring that it generalizes well to new data.

# MAGIC ### Discussion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Best Score and Parameters:**
# MAGIC The best cross-validated score during hyperparameter tuning was -0.0821, achieved with the parameters: batch_size of 16, dropout_rate of 0.3, epochs of 100, and units set to 50. These parameters were selected to optimize the model's performance, balancing model complexity and generalization.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
# MAGIC The MAE of 112.67 shows a slight increase compared to the base model's 111.69. This suggests that the optimized parameters did not improve the model's average prediction accuracy and resulted in a minor decline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
# MAGIC The MSE increased to 17,012.53 from the base model's 16,718.18, indicating that the model's ability to minimize larger errors has worsened slightly following the hyperparameter tuning. This suggests that the tuned model may be more prone to larger deviations from the actual values.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **R-squared:**
# MAGIC The R-squared value decreased slightly to -0.0096, compared to -0.0067 in the base model. This decline implies that the model's capacity to explain the variability in the data has diminished slightly, indicating that the hyperparameter tuning did not significantly enhance the model's performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **True vs Predicted Monthly Energy Cost:**
# MAGIC The true vs. predicted graph reveals that the optimized model continues to follow the overall trend of the actual data, similar to the base model. However, there are still areas of notable deviation, suggesting that the tuned model struggles to improve alignment with the true values.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Training & Validation Loss:**
# MAGIC The training and validation loss curves demonstrate a consistent decrease, though the validation loss remains higher than the training loss, indicating ongoing overfitting. The hyperparameter tuning did not significantly address this issue, as the loss curves show similar trends to those observed in the base model.

# MAGIC ## 3. Architecture Enhancements
# MAGIC This section explores various modifications to the model architecture to improve its ability to capture complex patterns in the data:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Adding Layers:
# MAGIC - Purpose: Stacking additional LSTM layers increases the depth of the model, allowing it to capture more intricate temporal patterns and dependencies in the data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Bidirectional LSTM:
# MAGIC - Purpose: Implementing bidirectional LSTM layers enables the model to process input data in both forward and backward directions, potentially improving its ability to understand patterns that unfold in different temporal orders.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Dense Layers:
# MAGIC - Purpose: Adding fully connected (Dense) layers after the LSTM layers allows the model to learn more complex, non-linear relationships between the features, enhancing its predictive power.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC GRU Layers:
# MAGIC - Purpose: Replacing LSTM layers with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) to evaluate whether GRU, which has a simpler structure, might perform better for this specific forecasting task. GRUs are often more efficient and can sometimes outperform LSTMs in certain scenarios.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC These architecture enhancements are aimed at improving the modelâ€™s ability to generalize and provide more accurate predictions by leveraging different model configurations and layer types.

# MAGIC Layers:
# MAGIC - Three LSTM layers
# MAGIC - One Dense layer
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Purpose:
# MAGIC - Increased Model Depth: Adding more LSTM layers enhances the modelâ€™s depth, allowing it to capture more complex patterns and dependencies in the sequential data. This is particularly important for time series forecasting, where relationships between data points can be intricate and multi-layered.
# MAGIC - Performance Testing: This architecture tests whether a deeper LSTM model, with additional layers, can improve the model's ability to learn from the data and ultimately enhance predictive accuracy. The additional layers aim to refine the model's understanding of long-term dependencies and subtle patterns within the dataset.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Layers:**
# MAGIC This model utilized two Bidirectional LSTM layers, which process data in both forward and backward directions, theoretically allowing the model to capture temporal dependencies more effectively. The goal was to test whether this bidirectional approach would improve performance compared to standard LSTMs.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):**
# MAGIC The MAE of 111.74 is slightly higher than the base modelâ€™s 111.69, suggesting that the bidirectional processing did not result in a significant improvement in average prediction accuracy. The minimal difference indicates that the added complexity of bidirectional layers did not substantially enhance the model's ability to reduce prediction errors.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
# MAGIC The MSE of 16,748.64 shows a slight increase compared to the base modelâ€™s 16,718.18. This indicates that the bidirectional LSTM model is slightly less effective at minimizing larger errors, reflecting a modest decline in performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **R-squared:**
# MAGIC The R-squared value of -0.0065 is nearly identical to the base modelâ€™s -0.0067, indicating that the bidirectional layers did not significantly improve the modelâ€™s ability to explain the variability in the data. The near-static R-squared suggests that the modelâ€™s overall explanatory power remains largely unchanged.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **True vs Predicted Monthly Energy Cost:**
# MAGIC The true vs. predicted graph reveals that the bidirectional LSTM model follows the overall trend of the actual data similarly to the base model. However, the deviations between predicted and actual values suggest that the bidirectional processing did not lead to a noticeable enhancement in capturing the temporal patterns.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Training & Validation Loss:**
# MAGIC The loss curves show a familiar pattern of decreasing losses with the validation loss remaining higher than the training loss, indicating that overfitting persists. The bidirectional layers did not significantly alter this trend, implying that the bidirectional approach did not improve the model's generalization ability as expected.

# MAGIC The MAE of 111.66 is very close to the base model's MAE of 111.69, indicating that the addition of the Dense layer with ReLU activation led to a slight improvement in prediction accuracy. This suggests that the model benefits modestly from the ability to learn more complex features.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Mean Squared Error (MSE):**
# MAGIC The MSE decreased to 16,683.54 from 16,718.18 in the base model. This slight reduction suggests that the model with the additional Dense layer is marginally better at minimizing larger errors, reflecting a minor improvement in handling the variability in the data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **R-squared:**
# MAGIC The R-squared value improved to -0.0026 from the base modelâ€™s -0.0067, indicating a slight enhancement in the modelâ€™s explanatory power. This suggests that the additional Dense layer helps the model capture more of the underlying variance in the data, even though the improvement is modest.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **True vs Predicted Monthly Energy Cost:**
# MAGIC The true vs. predicted graph shows a closer alignment between the predicted and actual values compared to previous models, with fewer deviations. This suggests that the additional Dense layer has helped the model better capture the temporal and non-linear patterns in the data, leading to slightly improved predictions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Training & Validation Loss:**
# MAGIC The loss curves indicate a steady decrease in both training and validation losses, with the validation loss slightly higher than the training loss. This pattern suggests that while some overfitting persists, the model generalizes better than those without the additional Dense layer. The inclusion of the Dense layer with ReLU activation appears to contribute to more effective learning of the data's complex relationships.

# MAGIC Layers:
# MAGIC - Two GRU layers
# MAGIC - One Dense layer
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Purpose:
# MAGIC - Simplified Recurrent Layers: GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers are designed to be simpler than LSTM layers, with fewer parameters and a more streamlined architecture. This simplicity can lead to faster training and sometimes better performance, particularly on datasets where the added complexity of LSTMs may not be necessary.
# MAGIC - Performance Testing: This model explores whether replacing LSTM layers with GRU layers can enhance performance. By comparing the two architectures, the goal is to determine if the simpler GRU layers offer a more efficient and effective solution for the specific forecasting task at hand.

# MAGIC #### Discussion
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Layers:**
# MAGIC This model incorporated an additional Dense layer with ReLU activation after the LSTM layers, designed to capture more complex non-linear relationships in the data. The goal was to evaluate whether this additional layer would improve the modelâ€™s predictive performance.

# MAGIC ## 4. Combined Model

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Feature Engineering:**
# MAGIC Time-based Features: Including hour, day_of_week, month, and year features, as these can help the model capture temporal patterns.
# MAGIC Lagged Features: Keep the lagged features like lag_1, lag_7, and lag_30, as they provide information on the dependency of the current value on previous values, which could help the model make more informed predictions.
# MAGIC External Factors: Maintain features such as temperature_celsius and humidity_percentage, which help capture external influences on the target variable.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
# MAGIC Optimal Parameters: From the hyperparameter tuning, it was observed that the chosen optimal parameters did not significantly improve performance. However, it's important to start with reasonable defaults and potentially re-tune after combining the architectural enhancements:
# MAGIC Batch Size: 32 (to balance between training speed and stability).
# MAGIC Dropout Rate: 0.2 (to mitigate overfitting, though this could be revisited).
# MAGIC Epochs: 50â€“100 (depending on early stopping, with patience to prevent overfitting).
# MAGIC Units: 50 per LSTM layer.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Architecture:**
# MAGIC Layers:
# MAGIC Three LSTM Layers: From the architectural tuning, it was evident that adding an extra LSTM layer provided modest improvements in capturing more complex patterns, as shown by a slight reduction in MSE and an improved R-squared value. Therefore, incorporating three LSTM layers should be beneficial.
# MAGIC One Dense Layer with ReLU Activation: The addition of a Dense layer with ReLU activation after the LSTM layers helped the model better learn non-linear relationships, contributing to slight performance gains. Including this layer should help the model handle more complex data patterns.
# MAGIC One Output Dense Layer: This layer is necessary for outputting the final predictions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Regularization:**
# MAGIC Dropout Layers: Incorporate a dropout layer (with a dropout rate of 0.2 to 0.3) after each LSTM layer to reduce overfitting. This was partially explored in the hyperparameter tuning models and should be maintained in the combined model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Early Stopping:**
# MAGIC Monitoring Validation Loss: Continue using early stopping to prevent overfitting. Set patience at 5 epochs, which seemed effective in your tests.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### **Proposed features**
# MAGIC The combined model should be based on the following structure:
# MAGIC Input Layer: Incorporate all the relevant features, including time-based, lagged, and external factor features.
# MAGIC Three LSTM Layers: Each with 50 units, followed by dropout layers with a dropout rate of 0.2 to 0.3.
# MAGIC Dense Layer with ReLU Activation: To help capture non-linear relationships in the data.
# MAGIC Output Dense Layer: To generate the final prediction.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **Final Recommendations:**
# MAGIC Re-tune the hyperparameters after combining the architectural changes, as their optimal values might shift with the new structure.
# MAGIC Experiment with alternative dropout rates and units in LSTM layers based on the new architecture.
# MAGIC Evaluate the combined model with cross-validation to ensure it generalizes well across different subsets of the data.
# MAGIC This combined model should leverage the benefits observed across your tests, potentially resulting in improved predictive performance.
